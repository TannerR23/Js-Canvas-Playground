# Js Canvas Playground

Just a fun mess around with certain ideas/creations using a canvas for visualisation.<br>
Not intended to look pretty or be too responsive -- mainly to be viewed on desktop for my own purpose.<br>
Project involves just raw JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Implemented
- Conway's Game of Life
- Falling Sand Simulation
- Maze generation & solver
